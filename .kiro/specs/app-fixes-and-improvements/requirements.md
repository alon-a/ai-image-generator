# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing and improving the AI Image Generator application. The current app has several issues including duplicate code, security vulnerabilities, inconsistent architecture, and missing functionality that need to be addressed to create a production-ready application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Architecture Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and consistent codebase architecture, so that the application is maintainable and follows Next.js best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is reviewed THEN there SHALL be only one main component handling the image generation UI
2. WHEN the project structure is examined THEN it SHALL follow Next.js conventions with pages in the correct directory
3. IF there are duplicate components THEN the system SHALL remove redundant code and consolidate functionality
4. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL use consistent styling approach throughout

### Requirement 2: Security and Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure and up-to-date dependencies, so that the application is safe from known vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package.json is reviewed THEN the system SHALL update Next.js to the latest stable version
2. WHEN dependencies are checked THEN all packages SHALL be updated to secure versions
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL not have any critical security vulnerabilities
4. IF environment variables are used THEN they SHALL be properly configured and documented

### Requirement 3: API Integration Fixes

**User Story:** As a user, I want the image generation to work reliably, so that I can create images from my text descriptions without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a prompt THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to FAL AI API
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
3. IF the API key is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
4. WHEN images are generated THEN they SHALL display correctly in the UI
5. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting appropriately

### Requirement 4: User Experience Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can easily generate and view images on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the interface SHALL be clean and easy to understand
2. WHEN generating images THEN the system SHALL show clear loading states
3. WHEN images are ready THEN they SHALL be displayed in an organized grid layout
4. IF an error occurs THEN the user SHALL see helpful error messages
5. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive

### Requirement 5: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and reliable image generation, so that I don't have to wait unnecessarily or encounter failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are being generated THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
2. WHEN API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN images load THEN they SHALL be optimized for web display
4. IF generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
5. WHEN multiple users access the app THEN it SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear setup instructions and proper configuration, so that I can easily deploy and maintain the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN there SHALL be clear documentation for all required environment variables
2. WHEN the app starts THEN it SHALL validate all required configuration
3. IF configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages
4. WHEN deploying THEN all necessary files SHALL be properly configured
5. WHEN running in development THEN hot reload SHALL work correctly
